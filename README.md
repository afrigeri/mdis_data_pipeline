# Messenger's MDIS Data Pipeline using GIT

This is the application of git for a planetary data processing pipeline, we will be using USGS's ISIS3 and MDIS data.

# Background

Remote Sensing data is usually processed on a Level base.  Level 0 (L0) is usually the lowest level, basically the data returned by the instrument's sensor.  Level 1 is the radiometrically calibrated version of the data. The data projection is returned into Level 2.  Level 3 is the place where Photometric correction occurs, where we are applying correction to the visible portion of the spectrum.
